# SQL-Server-Script-Test
This is an exercise in SQL Server scripting, queries, functions, stored procedures, and JSON formatted data

This project is an exercise in creating a real business requirement of:

a.       SQL script(s) that

a. Creates a PersonLoading table with an XML or JSON column

b. Creates a Person table with these columns (use best judgment for schema and table/column properties)

ID, FirstName, LastName, MobilePhone, StreetAddress, City, State, ZIP
c. Insert 10 records in XML or JSON format into the PersonLoading table with the same fields as Person table.

d. Create a scaler function that returns data (columns and rows) from the PersonLoading

e. Using the new function create a stored procedure that inserts the records into the Person table

f.  Execute the new stored procedure once

I used Microsoft SQL Server for a local test server, T-SQL for the code language, and MS Visual Studio for testing
